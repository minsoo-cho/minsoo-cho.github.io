This paper examines the determinants of box-office survival for films released in Seoul, South Korea.
Using data on 2,003 movies released between 2007 and 2019, we estimate a log-logistic Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model to identify key factors affecting a film’s duration within the weekly top 10 ranking.

**Main findings include:**

- Audience ratings and the number of screens at release significantly increase the survival time.
- The effect of quality signals has strengthened over time, indicating growing consumer influence in the movie market.
- Genre-specific differences exist in both the magnitude and significance of determinants.

These results contribute to understanding strategic film distribution and audience behavior in a rapidly evolving cultural market. Further details are available through the link above.
